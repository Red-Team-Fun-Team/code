Authors: [Cody Wishart](https://github.com/cwishart1), [Carsten Rossen](https://github.com/carsten-rossen), [Ethan Denny](https://github.com/ewhd)

Description: In this mock scenario RTFT has been contracted to perform a one-time adversary emulation engagement for [SimCorp](https://www.simcorp.com/). SimCorp is a financial asset management company. The CTO is concerned with their cloud infrastructure's security posture after having had sensitive data leaked due to a misconfiguration.

Red Team Objectives (RTOs):
- Enumerate the target network, gleaning as much information as possible about the various hosts and their configurations. Document in detail what tools were used and how much you were able to reveal.
- Discover vulnerabilities on targets hosts on the network. There will be at least one web application for you to discover and test against, in addition to several other instances running various operating systems with unknown configurations.
- Build/customize and utilize at least one custom Python tool to aid in your team's offensive efforts.
- Exploit and gain access to as many host instances as possible, and as deeply as possible.

Required Deliverable - Penetration Test Report
- As you describe the TTPs employed and vulnerabilities discovered in the main body of your report, ensure that you associate them with reputable community resources (e.g. CWE, CVSS, etc.)
- Replace Appendix B with a table listing all TTPs attempted mapped 1:1 to MITRE ATT&CK
